The lore of the **Super Saiyan** transformation originates from the anime and manga series *Dragon Ball Z*, created by Akira Toriyama. It is one of the most iconic transformations in anime history and is central to the *Dragon Ball* franchise, involving the powerful warrior race known as the **Saiyans**. Here's a breakdown of the Super Saiyan lore:

### 1. **The Saiyan Race**
Saiyans are a warrior race from the planet **Vegeta**. They are characterized by their combat prowess, a love for fighting, and their ape-like transformation known as the **Great Ape (Oozaru)** when exposed to the full moon. Despite their brutality, Saiyans have an innate potential for power growth, becoming stronger after every battle, especially after near-death experiences, a trait called **Zenkai Boost**.

### 2. **The Legend of the Super Saiyan**
The legend of the Super Saiyan is a long-standing myth among Saiyans. According to the myth, once every thousand years, a Saiyan of immense power is born who can access a transformation called **Super Saiyan**, granting them god-like strength. This warrior would be unstoppable and feared across the universe. The myth itself was unclear, but the transformation was considered a rare phenomenon—so much so that most Saiyans, including **Vegeta**, believed it to be nothing more than a fairy tale or legend.

### 3. **Super Saiyan Transformation**
The Super Saiyan transformation was first achieved by **Goku** (Kakarot), the main character of *Dragon Ball Z*, during his intense battle against **Frieza** on the planet Namek. The transformation is triggered by extreme emotional stress or rage, and it causes a dramatic boost in power. The transformation changes the Saiyan's physical appearance: 
- Hair turns **golden blonde**
- Eyes change to a **turquoise greenish-blue**
- Their aura becomes golden and crackling with energy
- The Saiyan’s muscles increase slightly, and their power level skyrockets.

### 4. **Emotional Trigger**
One key element in achieving the Super Saiyan transformation is a powerful emotional trigger, often related to anger or loss. Goku's transformation was fueled by the death of his friend **Krillin**, who was brutally killed by Frieza. The sheer emotional surge combined with his battle-hardened power allowed Goku to access this legendary form.

### 5. **Super Saiyan Forms**
As the series progressed, the concept of Super Saiyan evolved, with multiple variations and power-ups. Here are some of the most prominent forms:

#### a. **Super Saiyan 1 (SSJ1)**
The first form is achieved by Goku on Namek, marking the debut of the Super Saiyan transformation. This form grants a fiftyfold increase in base power. Vegeta, Gohan, and Future Trunks also achieved this form after intense training.

#### b. **Super Saiyan 2 (SSJ2)**
A more advanced and powerful version of Super Saiyan, first achieved by **Gohan** during the Cell Games Saga. The hair becomes spikier, the aura crackles with lightning, and the power is significantly greater. Gohan’s transformation was triggered by witnessing the death of Android 16 and the suffering of his friends at the hands of Cell.

#### c. **Super Saiyan 3 (SSJ3)**
This transformation was introduced by **Goku** during the Majin Buu Saga. Super Saiyan 3 is a significant power-up but has a heavy drawback due to its high energy consumption. The form is characterized by extremely long hair, lack of eyebrows, and an even more powerful aura. Goku uses this form sparingly due to its energy-draining nature.

#### d. **Super Saiyan God (SSG)**
Introduced in *Dragon Ball Super*, this transformation is achieved by absorbing the power of a ritual involving six pure-hearted Saiyans. Super Saiyan God is leaner and faster, with red hair and eyes. This form elevates a Saiyan’s power to divine levels, allowing them to rival deities like **Beerus, the God of Destruction**.

#### e. **Super Saiyan Blue (SSGSS)**
Super Saiyan Blue is the combination of Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan power, blending godly ki with the traditional Super Saiyan transformation. It is marked by blue hair and a more stable, calm energy compared to Super Saiyan God. This form is a staple in *Dragon Ball Super*, with Goku and Vegeta using it frequently.

#### f. **Super Saiyan 4 (SSJ4)**
This form is non-canon in the main series and is introduced in *Dragon Ball GT*. Super Saiyan 4 is achieved by combining the Great Ape transformation with Super Saiyan power, resulting in a hybrid form where the user retains human size but is covered in fur and retains aspects of the Oozaru (great ape) power.

### 6. **The Power and Drawbacks**
While Super Saiyan transformations grant immense power, they are not without drawbacks:
- **Energy Drain:** Higher forms like Super Saiyan 3 consume a significant amount of energy, limiting how long a Saiyan can stay in the form.
- **Emotional Instability:** Some transformations, like the original Super Saiyan or Berserk forms (like Broly’s), can lead to emotional instability and uncontrollable rage.
- **Training and Mastery:** Transformations like Super Saiyan Blue require precise control over ki and energy, meaning they need constant training and refinement to maintain efficiency.

### 7. **Super Saiyan in the Lore of the Universe**
In *Dragon Ball*, the Super Saiyan transformation becomes a focal point not just for Goku and Vegeta but also for characters like **Broly**, who is depicted as the "Legendary Super Saiyan" in certain continuities. His transformation is different from others, as it involves an uncontrollable, overwhelming power that exceeds that of regular Super Saiyans.

Later in the franchise, the Saiyan race's potential to evolve through different transformations (Super Saiyan God, Blue, Ultra Instinct, etc.) becomes a cornerstone in the evolving storyline, especially as they interact with gods, angels, and other universes.

### 8. **Ultra Instinct: Beyond Super Saiyan**
While not a Super Saiyan form, **Ultra Instinct** is considered one of the highest forms of power achieved by Goku in *Dragon Ball Super*. It involves perfecting the body’s instinctual responses without conscious thought. This form pushes Goku beyond the limits of even Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue, entering the realm of the gods.

### Conclusion
The Super Saiyan transformation started as a legendary and nearly mythical form but became a foundational element in *Dragon Ball Z* and beyond. It represents the Saiyans' unparalleled potential for growth, especially Goku’s and Vegeta’s endless pursuit of power. It also serves as a symbol of Saiyan pride, struggle, and the desire to protect those they care about. Each new form in the franchise has continued to expand the legacy of Super Saiyan, making it a central theme in the *Dragon Ball* universe.
